# Luna

Luna is an in-development software design tool in the vein of figma, sketchapp, and old Framer.

It's built on top of [gpui](https://www.gpui.rs/), the UI framework designed by the @zedindustries team to power [zed](https://github.com/zedindustries/zed).

Luna is in active development, and is very firmly in the "toy editor" stage right now.
